# Good Bye Vehicle Collision

Disables vehicle-to-vehicle collision avoidance. Vehicles will drive through each other instead of waiting in traffic queues.

## Features

- Vehicles ignore pedestrians
- Smooth acceleration when passing through obstacles

## Still Respected

- Speed limits
- Emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance)
- Trains at railroad crossings
- Parking scenarios

## Settings
- Can be enabled/disabled in the game options menu

Inspired by the original Collision Be Gone mod for Cities: Skylines 1.

This mod is currently in its initial version, with significant room for improvement and refinement.
